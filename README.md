Live demo on the Ethereum Goerli testnet. An Ethereum web3 browser is required to view the Dapp, I  recommend using MetaMask.

## How does it work?

When you upload an image a request is sent to the Magnolia smart contract which lives on the Ethereum testnet. The smart contract hashes the image to the ipfs (InterPlanetary File System) and then stores the data on chain.
